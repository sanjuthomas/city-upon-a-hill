They thrust her down.

He tried to lift her up.

Then they pushed him to the ground.

Then they disarmed him.

Then they fired, again and again, until his soul left us.

Then they cut his clothes.

Then they counted his wounds, one by one.

Then they rejoiced.

They knew their king would be happy and trophies would be given away.

All of it was done to keep old promises:

Remember that Fifth Avenue boast?

Remember who shot her dog for sport?

They are here now, in the city that was supposed to shine on a hill.

I can see them. Can you?

There is still hope, if only because there is no “Chief Election Commissioner” in Washington, D.C. yet.
