When Martha Nussbaum spoke about “nations of docile engineers,” I initially thought she was exaggerating. 
But after spending a few months in a New Jersey office, my view changed. 
I met people who, in the same breath, condemn one authoritarian leader and glorify another who gladly sings and dances for the first. 
I met others who openly pray for the demise of the dollar, even as they work for the fourth-largest American bank and seem unable to grasp that they are literally and figuratively paid every other Friday in dollars to make dollars available to America’s friends and allies anytime, anywhere, at will. 
This is a tragedy not only for the country they came from, but also for America, because sooner or later, these docile engineers will also become voters here.
