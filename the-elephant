He arrived in a Valley of Ashes with two shirts and a name no one bothered to pronounce.
They laughed at his accent.
They handed him brushes and buckets.
They told him to scrub what they did not wish to see.

He learned instead.

He learned the language.
He learned the circuits.
He learned how to turn sand into lightning.

One day, he built a machine that could think in sparks.
The sparks became tools.
The tools became companies.
The companies became empires.

The boy who cleaned bathrooms in coal country now moves the gears of the future.
His creation grew so vast that only nations were capable of rivaling it.
Engineers chant his name.
Presidents wait in line.
Markets flutter when he speaks.

He became an elephant.

Not the kind that plods through dust,
but a flying elephant — immense, untouchable, impossible to ignore.

But somewhere above the clouds, the elephant began bowing to a paper crown.

Every season, he carried gifts to a throne made of noise.
He lifted a banner that was never his.
He lent his thunder to a voice that did not need it.

Perhaps altitude blurred his memory.
Perhaps applause is louder than conscience.

But elephants are known for their memory.
And this one must remember:

He was not built to kneel.
He was built to stand.

He was never meant to be a megaphone for petty men.
He was meant to be the strength in the room.



And I used one of his creations to polish this writing.
