America has always had foreign nationals on its soil. That’s not controversial. It’s a nation built by immigrants.

What’s fascinating lately, though, is the rise of a new species: the nationalist immigrant.

They relocate to the United States.
They work here.
They enjoy its freedoms, its markets, its protections.
They secure passports, mortgages, and retirement accounts.

And then — with admirable confidence — they declare themselves nationalists.

Not of the country they now live in.

Of the one they left.

It’s a remarkable intellectual maneuver:

One has to ask — which nation exactly anchors their political loyalty?

And if the answer changes depending on convenience, is that nationalism… or branding?
