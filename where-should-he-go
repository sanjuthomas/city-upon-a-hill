He first saw the marching legs in a crowd —
not coming toward him,
but toward a parliament he had only seen on stamps.
Their boots made a sound like erasing.

So he stood before a glass fortress
where foreign flags snapped in the wind
and asked for a doorway out.
A stamp.
A number.
A narrow bureaucratic bridge.

And suddenly, he was climbing
toward the city on the hill he had read about in schoolbooks.

Here, he traded dust for elevators,
smog for glass,
fear for deadlines.

He learned the language of meetings and calendars.
He wrote code beneath fluorescent skies.
He watched promotions bloom —
until the harvest came with someone else’s name on it.

They were here too.

Not in uniforms now,
but in tailored suits.
Not on parade grounds,
but in corner offices.

They wrote the rules.
Hired reflections of themselves.

It was not strangers who cut deepest.

It was travelers from his own land —
men who had fled the fire
and now called him the spark.

They named him “agent of the West.”
for reading its books,
for loving its questions,
for believing its promises.

Yet they wrapped themselves comfortably in every freedom, its flag could buy.

One morning at work, no one tugged at his accent.
They tugged at his faith —
the same faith that had once built cathedrals and constitutions here,
the stories of conscience and doubt he had carried across an ocean like contraband.

Now it was suspect.
Old.
Dangerous.

Back home, they told him he did not belong because he loved the West.

Here, under a different flag,
the same men —
traded Khaki trousers for Western suits,
asked why he had come at all.

And walking beneath the lit hill, he held the question like a stone in his mouth:

Where does a boy like him set down his name?
